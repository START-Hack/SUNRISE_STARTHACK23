## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Welcome to the StartHack of 2023.

We'r Sunrise, specifically the Tribe "Wilmaa" within Sunrise. We've build yallo TV https://yallo.tv and Live Mysports https://live.mysports.ch. Our development ist mainly focused on OTT/TV.

TV is not dead! There is still a lot of exlcusive TV Content people watch and enjoy. To name just some: Live sports, Batchelor etc. 

Our Middleware and Clients are custom made by us. On top of that we have a lot of realtime Sports Data.This is an opportunity to do something with this capabilities.

How can we bring people together to enjoy and share TV moments? Groupwatch/Watchparties is just the beginning! WE CAN DO MORE!

Have fun and may the force be with you :)

## <p align="center"> Further Information: </p>

We have our custom made Middleware with which we have full control of the whole TV Environment. On top of that our clients are build 100% within our team and all the clients do establish a websocket connection to our Middlware. This Websocket connection is bi-directional. Our Middleware can actively send data to connected clients where the clients can also send data to the backend (and other clients trough the middleware).

Besides that we have Google Dataflow Pipelines which are processing in realtime live sports data. We know when a Goal, Foul, Period change happends. At the moment we'r not doing too much with this data.
